filterlinks - filter the link file based on link parameters

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="RULES">RULES</A></H1>
<P>
A filter rules contains two parts: the link parameter which is tested and a
list of acceptable conditions.

<P>
The two exceptions are the -nointer and -nointra flags. These can be used
to filter out inter-chromosomal links (ends of link are on different
chromosomes) and intra-chromosomal links (ends of link are on the same
chromosome). These two rules are strict, meaning that if a link does not
pass them, no other rules are tested and the link is immediately rejected.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Link_Parameters">Link Parameters</A></H2>
<P>
<PRE>  link_param = condition1,condition2,...
</PRE>
<P>
Because each link has two ends, each link parameter may give rise to three
distinct rules

<P>
<PRE>  link_param   = condition1,condition2,...
  link_param_1 = condition1,condition2,...
  link_param_2 = condition1,condition2,...
</PRE>
<P>
which test, respectively, both ends with the condition (both ends must
pass), the first end, and the second end. The first end of the link
corresponds to the first line of the link line pair. For example, given the
link ... link018136 cf12 9800000 9900000 link018136 hs6 37914056 37916509
...

<P>
the first end is cf12:9800000-9900000 and the second end is
hs6:37914056-37916509.

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_chr">chr</A></STRONG>
<P>
Applies the condition to the chromosome of the link.

<P>
<PRE>  chr   = 1
  chr_2 = x
</PRE>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_start">start, end, size</A></STRONG>
<P>
Applies the condition to the start, end or size of the link. The link size
is end-start+1.

<P>
<PRE>  start = [?&lt;]10000000
  end   = [?&gt;]50000000
</PRE>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_span">span</A></STRONG>
<P>
Applies the condition to the span of the link and should be used with the
``s'' condition TYPE.

<P>
<PRE>  span = [?i]1000-2000
</PRE>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_id">id</A></STRONG>
<P>
Applies the condition to the id of the link.

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_color">color, thickness, z, etc.</A></STRONG>
<P>
Any condition that is not one of id, chr, start, end, size, span is assumed
to be a link option and is applied to the option of the link. For example,
options include color, thickness, and z.

<P>
<PRE>  color = [?e]chr12
  z = [?&gt;]10
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Conditions">Conditions</A></H2>
<P>
A condition has the following format

<P>
<PRE>  { [?TYPE {ID} {!} ] } CONDITION
</PRE>
<P>
where elements in { } are optional. Briefly, TYPE is used to indicate how
the CONDITION text should be applied (e.g. regular expression, integer
range, exact match, etc). The ID is used to combine rules so that their
match status is AND'ed together to determine whether the link passes. The
trailing ``!'' is used to negate the rule (i.e. for the link to pass, the
rule must fail).

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Default">Default Condition is a Regular Expression</A></STRONG>
<P>
If no optional elements in the condition are specified, it is treated as a
regular expression. For example,

<P>
<PRE>  LINK_PARAM = 12
</PRE>
<P>
would apply the regular expression ``12'' to the link parameter. You can
provide a list of conditions with ;; as a delimiter (you can adjust the
delimiter in the configuration file).

<P>
<PRE>  LINK_PARAM = 12;;x;;y
</PRE>
<P>
which are interpreted as a series of regular expressions used to test the
link parameter. The link will be passed if ANY condition matches (i.e.
match results are OR'ed). If you want match results to be AND'ed (i.e.
multiple rules must match for the link to pass, read below).

<P>
The regular expression is case-insensitive.

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Adjusting">Adjusting Condition Type</A></STRONG>
<P>
The following conditions types are possible

<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_r">r - regular expression (default)</A></STRONG>
<P>
<PRE>  LINK_PARAM = 12
  LINK_PARAM = 12;;x;;y
</PRE>
<P>
You can specify the type as a regular expression explicitly with [?r] but
this is not necessary because that is the default.

<P>
<PRE>  LINK_PARAM = [?r]12;;[?r]x;;[?r]y
</PRE>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_s">s - integer span</A></STRONG>
<P>
The syntax of the integer range is any string supported by Set::IntSpan.

<P>
<PRE>  LINK_PARAM = [?s]1000-2000
  LINK_PARAM = [?s]1000-2000,3000-4000
  LINK_PARAM = [?s]1000-2000,3000-)
  LINK_PARAM = [?s](-1000,2000,3000-)
  LINK_PARAM = [?s](-1000,2000,3000-4000,5000-)
</PRE>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_e">e - exact match</A></STRONG>
<P>
The exact match is useful for matching chromosome names in cases where
regular expressions might match other chromosomes (and you don't want to
include anchors in your regular expression).

<P>
<PRE>  LINK_PARAM = [?e]chr1
  LINK_PARAM = [?e]chr1;;[?e]chr2
</PRE>
<P>
Note that the condition type must be prefixed to each individual condition,
if a list of conditions is supplied.

<P>
The exact match is not case-sensitive.

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item__less_than">&lt; - less than</A></STRONG>
<P>
If the value is a number, numerical &lt; is used, otherwise the values are
compared based on asciibetic order (e.g. le).

<P>
<PRE>  # LINK_PARAM must be less than 100
  LINK_PARAM = [?&lt;]100
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>  # LINK_PARAM must be less (in the asciibetic sense) than chr20 (e.g. chr1, chr11, chr111, chr19, etc)
  LINK_PARAM = [?&lt;]chr20
</PRE>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item__greater_than">&gt; - greater than</A></STRONG>
<P>
Works just like the less than condition [?&lt;].

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_mixing">mixing condition types</A></STRONG>
<P>
You can have multiple condition types for a parameter. Remember that
results of each condition will be OR'ed together.

<P>
<PRE>  LINK_PARAM = 1,[?e]chr5,[?e]chr22
</PRE>
<P>
The first condition is a regular expression (by default). The second and
third conditions are exact text matches for chr5 and chr22. Thus, the
LINK_PARAM will pass if (a) it contains a ``1'', or (b) it is ``chr5'' or
(c) it is ``chr22''.

</UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Negating">Negating a Condition</A></STRONG>
<P>
In order to negate a condition, use ``!''. When ``!'' is used, the
condition must fail for the result to be acceptable.

<P>
<PRE>  # must not match regular expression &quot;1&quot;
  LINK_PARAM = [?r!]1
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>  # must not be &quot;chr12&quot;
  LINK_PARAM = [?e!]chr12
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>  # must not be within the range 1000-2000
  LINK_PARAM = [?i!]1000-2000
</PRE>
<P>
In order to combine negated conditions with positive ones, you will need to
group conditions so that their results are AND'ed.

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Grouping">Grouping Conditions</A></STRONG>
<P>
So far, all condition results were evaluated with OR. In other words, if
you had a list of conditions, the successful pass of any of the conditions
resulted in the link being passed. This is useful if you want to accept
multiple values 

<P>
<PRE>  # chr12 or chr14 
  LINK_PARAM = [?e]chr12;;[?e]chr14
</PRE>
<P>
However, what if you wanted to match regular expression ``1'' but not
chr14. Here's where the ID field comes in. By tagging multiple conditions
with the same ID field the results of each of these conditions is AND'ed
together to determine whether the link passes.

<P>
<PRE>  # ID=0 
  # match regular expression &quot;1&quot; AND not be &quot;chr14&quot;
  LINK_PARAM = [?r0]1;;[?e0!]chr14
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</A></H1>
<P>
Below are some examples to get you started. Note the interplay between
conditions with IDs and condition without IDs. The former collate
conditions into AND'ed sets, which are then in turn OR'ed with other sets
and with conditions without IDs.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Filtering_by_Chromosomes">Filtering by Chromosomes</A></H2>
<P>
To select links in which both ends match regular expression ``1''

<P>
<PRE>  chr = 1
</PRE>
<P>
So simple. Now, to select links in with either ends matches regular
expression ``1'', 

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1 = 1
  chr_2 = 1
</PRE>
<P>
The difference between these two cases is that in the first instance, since
the link_parameter does not include a _1 or _2 suffix, the condition is
applied to both ends of the link and both ends must pass. In the second
case, each end is tested independently and the results are OR'ed together.

<P>
If you want links where the first chromosome matches x or the second
matches y,

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1 = x
  chr_2 = y
</PRE>
<P>
The test is (chr_1 match ``x'') OR (chr_2 match ``y''). Note, however, that
this set of rules requires that the first chromosome match ``x'' OR the
second chromosome match ``y''. It will fail if the first chromosome matches
``y'' and the second matches ``x''. To match both possibilities, you might
try

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1 = x;;y
  chr_2 = y;;x
</PRE>
<P>
In this case the test is (chr_1 match ``x'') OR (chr_1 match ``y'') OR
(chr_2 match ``x'') OR (chr_2 match ``y''). 

<P>
If you are looking for links between x and y chromosomes, then you require
the results of each condition to be AND'ed. For this, use IDs

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1 = [?r1]x
  chr_2 = [?r1]y
</PRE>
<P>
Both of these rules have ID=1 and are therefore grouped into a set. Match
results within a set are AND'ed. Thus, the test is (chr_1 match ``x'') AND
(chr_2 match ``y''). If you want to match the other order too,

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1 = [?r1]x;;[?r2]y
  chr_2 = [?r1]y;;[?r2]x
</PRE>
<P>
In this example, there are two IDs. The rules with ID=0 match chr1 to ``x''
and chr2 to ``y'' and the rules with ID=1 match the converse (chr1 to ``y''
and chr2 to ``x''). 

<P>
Now let's suppose we want links that are either cf1-hs6, cf14-hs7 or
cfx-hsx. Here cf is a dog chromosome and hs is a human chromosome. The rule
for this is

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1 = [?e1]cf1;;[?e2]cf14;;[?e3]cfx
  chr_2 = [?e1]hs6;;[?e2]hs7;;[?e3]hsx
</PRE>
<P>
You can add additional conditions without IDs to accept more links. For
example, if you also wanted to add any links for which chr_1 was cf9 or for
which chr_2 matched ``3''

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1 = [?e1]cf1;;[?e2]cf14;;[?e3]cfx;;[?e]cf9
  chr_2 = [?e1]hs6;;[?e2]hs7;;[?e3]hsx;;3
</PRE>
<P>
Remember that [?r]3 is the same as 3, since the default condition type is a
regular expression.

<P>
You can take advantage of the ``!'' flag to negate rules to avoid
chromosomes. For example, if you want links between cfx and any chromosome
other than hsx

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1 = [?e1]cfx
  chr_2 = [?e1!]hsx
</PRE>
<P>
and here the test is (chr_1 is cfx) AND (chr_2 is not hsx). 

<P>
You can combine chr with chr_1/chr_2 rules

<P>
<PRE>  chr   = 2
  chr_1 = [?e1]cfx
  chr_2 = [?e1!]hsx
</PRE>
<P>
to produce the test ( (chr_1 is cfx) AND (chr_2 is not hsx) ) OR ( chr_1
matches ``2'' AND chr_2 matches ``2'' ). Use ``chr'' as the parameter if
you want to apply the same condition to both ends of th elink and chr_1 and
chr_2 to apply different conditions.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Filtering_by_Position">Filtering by Position</A></H2>
<P>
To test link position, use the parameters ``start'', ``end'' and ``span''.
Both ``start'' and ``end'' are ideal for testing with condition type &lt;
and &gt;. To select links for which both ends start before 10,000,000

<P>
<PRE>  start = [?&lt;]1e7
  # or
  start = [?&lt;]10000000
</PRE>
<P>
to add another OR'ed condition to pass links with start values beyond
100,000,000

<P>
<PRE>  start = [?&lt;]1e7;;[?&gt;]1e8
</PRE>
<P>
A more complex test for the ``start'' and ``end'' values can be leveled by
using the ``s'' condition type, which tests for membership within a span.
This rule

<P>
<PRE>  start = [?i]1e6-2e6,3e6-4e6
</PRE>
<P>
will pass links for which both ends are within 1-2Mb or 3-4Mb. Note that
the ``,'' in this condition is part of the span and does not create a new
condition. To have two conditions, use the ;; delimiter.

<P>
<PRE>  start = [?i]1e6-2e6,3e6-4e6;;[?s]1e7-1.1e7,3e6-4e6
</PRE>
<P>
When using the ``span'' parameter, you should always use the ``s''
condition type. This will check whether the link span intersects the
provided span.

<P>
<PRE>  span = [?s]2e7-5e7
</PRE>
<P>
This will select all links whose spans (at both ends) intersect the
coordinates 20-50Mb. To be more selective, use the _1 and _2 suffixes.

<P>
<PRE>  span_1 = [?s1]2e7-5e7
  span_2 = [?s1]2e7-2.5e7
</PRE>
<P>
will select links joining 20-50Mb regions to 20-25Mb regions. An ID was
required here to make the results AND'ed. To avoid certain regions, use the
``!'' flag

<P>
<PRE>  span = [?s!](-1e7
</PRE>
<P>
will avoid all links within the first 10Mb.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Filtering_by_Link_Options">Filtering by Link Options</A></H2>
<P>
Any link option such as ``color'', ``thickness'', or ``z'' can be tested in
similar rules. 

<P>
<PRE>  # links with z value greater than 10
  z = [?&gt;]10 
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>  # links with z value between 5 and 15
  z = [?s]5-15
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Mixing_Conditions_and_IDs">Mixing Conditions and IDs</A></H2>
<P>
You can write fairly complex rules by combining different link parameter,
rule types and IDs.

<P>
For example to apply the following filter

<P>
<PRE>  (
  between (hs1 and cf6) 
  AND
  within 75-80 Mb on hs1
  AND 
  larger than 5kb on hs1
  )
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>  OR
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>  (
  larger than 500kb on hs1
  )
</PRE>
<P>
use the following rules

<P>
<PRE>  chr_1   = [?e1]cf6
  chr_2   = [?e1]hs1
  span_2  = [?s1]75e6-80e6
  size_2  = [?&gt;1]5e3;;[?&gt;]500e3
