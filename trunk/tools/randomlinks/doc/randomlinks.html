<P>
Generate a link data file suitable for use in Circos containing random
links between chromosomes. Chromosomes are sampled from the karyotype file
KARYOTYPE_FILE and optionally further filtered using the regular expression
REGEX.

<P>
The number of links between any two chromosome pairs is determined by rules
(read below). The size of each link is determined by the average and
standard deviation values provided by -size.

<P>
Intrachromosomal links can be avoided using -nointra. Similiarly,
interchromosomal links can be avoided using -nointer. The -nointer option
is much less useful.

<P>
Given a filtered set of chromosomes (first sampled from the KARYOTYPE_FILE
and then passed through the regular expression REGEX), the number of links
joining any pair of chromosomes is determined by a set of rules. 

<P>
Each rule contains two regular expressions, one for each of the chromosomes
in the pair, and these determine which pairs of chromosomes the rule will
apply to. 

<P>
For example, if the regular expressions are ``.'' and ``.'' then all
chromosome pairs are matched. However, if the regular expressions are ``.''
and ``chr10'' then only pairs of chromosomes for which one contains chr10
are affected.

<P>
In addition to the regular expression selection filter, each rule contains
either (a) avg/sd parameters used to generate a normally distributed random
number which is used as the number of links between the selected
chromosomes, or (b) a multiplier which is used to multiply the number of
links as determined by a previous rule.

<P>
Optionally, rules may contain a sampling parameter which determines how
frequently the rule is applied.

<P>
Rules are applied in increasing order of specificity. Thus, rules that
affect the largest number of chromosome pairs are applied first, followed
by rules that affect fewer pairs.

<P>
For more details about the syntax of rules, see etc/randomlinks.conf.
